## :construction_worker: Running Locally

Disclaimer: This project fetches data from my personal [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) workspace, thus it's necessary to define the CMS endpoint as a environment variable, otherwise it's not possible to fully execute the scripts bellow

#### Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LauraBeatris/laurabeatris.com.git
```

#### Define environment variables
```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

#### Install dependencies & execute web application in development mode
```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

Define the environment variables by creating a .env.local file similar to [.env.local.example](https://github.com/LauraBeatris/laurabeatris.com/blob/master/.env.local.example)

# :postbox: Faq

**Question:** What are the technologies used in this project?

**Answer:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Styled Component](https://styled-components.com/) and [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/)

**Question** Why Next.js instead of other frameworks of React out there?

**Answer** I chose Next.js in order to opt out for different rendering strategies
